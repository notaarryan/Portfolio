## ‚öõÔ∏è Migration to React & Modern Web Architecture

This portfolio was originally built as a static site using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has since been **migrated to a modern React-based architecture**, leveraging component-driven development, state management, and a scalable codebase.

### Why React?
- **Reusable Components:** UI sections are modularized into independent, reusable React components (e.g., `Nav`, `HeroSection`, `MainSection`), making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **State Management:** Features like dark/light mode toggling and scroll-to-top button visibility are managed through React state and hooks, enabling responsive, interactive UI updates.
- **Modern Workflow:** The project uses modern tooling (`npm`, JSX, ES6+), and supports hot reloading for a seamless development experience.

### Component Structure
- `App.jsx`: The root component, manages global state (theme, scroll button).
- `Nav.jsx`: Navigation bar with theme toggle.
- `MainSection.jsx`: Main content wrapper.
- `HeroSection.jsx`: Animated hero section with tech stack cards.
- Additional sections and components are easily extendable due to the modular structure.

### Development Workflow
- **Install dependencies** with `npm install`
- **Run locally** with `npm start` (hot reloading enabled)
- **Production builds** are optimized for performance and maintainability.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React** (component-based UI library)
- **HTML5** (via JSX)
- **CSS3** (custom properties, grid, flexbox, animations, transitions; imported as modules)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** (functional components, hooks, modular code)
- **Webpack** (modular bundling for production and development)
- **Jest** (unit testing)
- **Babel** (transpiling modern JS/JSX)
- **ESLint** (code linting)

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Mastery

- Component-driven development with React
- Responsive web design & mobile-first development
- Advanced CSS (variables, grid, flexbox, media queries)
- React hooks for interactivity and state (e.g., theme, scroll events)
- Local storage for theme persistence
- Interactive UI features (card rotation, scroll-to-top button, dark/light mode toggle)
- Modular code structure and maintainability
- Accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, alt tags)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, Open Graph)
- Git & GitHub for version control and deployment

## üìÇ Notable Features

- **Dynamic Hero Section:** Animated tech stack cards with smooth transitions (powered by React state and effects)
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Persistent theme toggle with local storage, managed by React
- **Scroll-to-Top Button:** Appears on scroll for improved UX (React state-driven)
- **Projects Showcase:** Live GitHub repository pins with direct links
- **About & Contact Sections:** Education, tech stack, certifications, and social links
- **Mobile Friendly:** Fully responsive layout for all devices
- **Social Sharing:** Open Graph meta tags for rich previews
- **Site Icon:** Favicon and apple-touch-icon for browser and sharing visibility
